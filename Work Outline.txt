### Notebooks
- IEX_OO_Shadowtests.ipynb 
    - Tested out beamline_29.py (shadow-based simulation of 29ID)
    - played with ranges of each DOF
    - built data set for surrogate training
- IEX_surrogate_NN.ipynb
    - train and test NN on shadow generated data
- IEX_shadow_vs_surrogate.ipynb
    - test time usage of both beamlines --> surrogate ~ 1ms, shadow ~ 1s per "measurement"
- GA_vs_beamline.ipynb
    - goal: to test out simple genetic algorithm to find _optimal_ beamline configuration
    - Starting populations of 10, ... generations 
    - Finding that GA finds solution pretty quickly but many disparate solutions exist for peak intensity
    - >>> go back to beamline_29.py and add other "diagnostics" e.g. beam dimensions, beam position, beam image
    
    
Test environment
- EPICS IOC (100idWYM)
    - 16 axes of simulated motors
    - Simulated area detector
    - basic calcs using motors to move "beam" around on simulated detector
- Bluesky implementation __in progress__
    - motor definitions (tied to 100idWYM)
    - Tie simulated detector to beamline model (shadow or surrogate)
    - Use to develop "plans" for "optimizing" beamline
    
Needs/TODO
    - Smarter ranges for motors (describe prior work by Trent)
    - Move to multi-objective? nrays not best approach --> beam position + FWHM + intensity?
